# Hi there! üëã

I'm **Germain AMOVIN**, an **Image, Development and 3D Technology Engineer** with a passion for **Graphic Development**, **Computer Vision**, and **Embedded Systems**. Since 2016, I've been diving deep into the world of development, contributing to a wide array of projects‚Äîbe it personal ventures, academic research, open-source contributions, or enterprise solutions.

While much of my work has been developed locally or resides in private repositories, I'm now excited to share some of my non-private projects here on GitHub. I believe in the power of collaboration and the importance of showcasing one's work to the community.
